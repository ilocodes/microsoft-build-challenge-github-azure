# How to Establish an Open-Source Program

## What is Open Source?

An open-source program involves more than just making a codebase publicly available. It’s about creating a living project that encourages participation from anyone interested. When done correctly, open-sourcing a project can lead to substantial improvements in the quality of your product through community contributions.

## Goals of Open Source

Open source aims to foster community involvement in three main dimensions:

1. **Consumers**: Individuals or organizations that study or use open-source repositories created by others.
2. **Contributors**: People who actively contribute to the improvement of open-source projects developed by others.
3. **Producers**: Entities that build and maintain their own repositories and open them up for public participation.

## Open-Source Process Levels

Organizations can assess their open-source maturity through five process levels:

1. **Ad hoc**: There is no formal process in place; success relies on individual efforts.
2. **Managed**: A partially documented process exists; success depends on disciplined execution.
3. **Defined**: Processes are documented, standardized, and integrated; success depends on automation.
4. **Measured**: Processes are quantitatively managed; success depends on measuring metrics against business goals.
5. **Optimized**: Processes are continually improving through incremental and innovative changes; success depends on minimizing the risk of change.

To evaluate where your organization stands, consider using open-source self-assessments.

## Criteria for Open-Sourcing a Project

Before deciding to open-source a project, consider the following criteria:

- **Intellectual Property**: Ensure the project does not contain proprietary information you wish to protect. Weigh the benefits against the risks of making the code public.
- **Code Quality**: The project should be in a stable state with good code quality. Potential contributors may be discouraged if the codebase is poorly maintained.
- **Usefulness**: The project should offer value to people outside your company. If it’s not useful to others, participation will be minimal.
- **Accessibility**: External contributors need access to all project dependencies and build processes. They should be able to run the project easily.
- **Support**: Ensure your team has the bandwidth to support an open-source project. Inadequate support can damage your reputation and hinder community trust.

## Designing an Open-Source Program

Running an open-source program involves several key elements, similar to managing an InnerSource program but aimed at a public audience.

### Setting Community Expectations

- **Documentation**: Files like `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` are crucial. They should be written from the perspective of someone outside the organization to ensure clarity and completeness.
- **Code of Conduct**: Include a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file to outline the expected behavior of participants. This document should be reviewed by multiple groups within your organization, including legal teams. There are many standard codes of conduct available that you can adopt with little to no modification.

### Preparing Employees

Employees may need guidance on how to interact with the open-source community. Provide internal resources such as:

1. **"Should We Open-Source This Project?" Guide**: This should offer a framework for deciding whether a project is suitable for open-sourcing. It could be structured as a flowchart, a set of questions, or a list of considerations.

2. **Setup Checklist**: This list should include all necessary tasks before and after launching an open-sourced project. Tasks might include:
    - Acquiring approval to open-source the project.
    - Conducting code reviews to remove sensitive data.
    - Performing trademark or open-source project searches to avoid naming conflicts.

3. **Contact List**: Provide a list of key contacts within your organization who can offer support. This should include representatives from software security, site security, legal, and public relations.

4. **Starter Repository**: Offer a template repository that includes essential files such as a sample README, license, code of conduct, and contributing guide. This ensures consistency across all open-source projects.

5. **Maintainer’s Guide**: Explain the responsibilities of maintainers, such as keeping documentation up to date and managing issues and pull requests efficiently.

6. **Communications Guide**: Offer guidance on sensitive topics that shouldn't be included in public files. This might cover business-sensitive information or guidelines on how to interact with contributors.

7. **Internal FAQ**: Provide answers to common questions, especially those with legal implications.

8. **License Policy**: List the licenses approved or rejected by the legal department for consuming or contributing to open-source projects.

## What to Open Source?

Not every project is suitable for open-sourcing. Evaluate your projects against these criteria:

- **Intellectual Property**: Does the project contain valuable IP you want to protect?
- **Code Stability and Quality**: Is the project in a stable state with good quality code?
- **Usefulness**: Is the project useful to people outside your organization?
- **Accessibility**: Can external contributors easily access and run the project?
- **Support Capacity**: Does your team have the resources to support the project once it’s open-sourced?

## Designing an Open-Source Program

An open-source program should have clear guidelines and support structures in place. This includes comprehensive documentation, a clear code of conduct, and well-prepared employees.

By thoughtfully establishing and managing an open-source program, organizations can foster community involvement, drive innovation, and improve their products through collaborative efforts.
