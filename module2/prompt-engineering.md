# What is prompt engineering?
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting clear instructions to guide AI systems, like GitHub Copilot, to generate context-appropriate code tailored to your project's specific needs. This ensures the code is syntactically, functionally, and contextually correct. Think of it like giving precise directions to a driver. Without them, the journey might be inefficient. But with clear guidance, the route becomes direct and efficient, saving time and energy. In this scenario, you're the one providing directions, and GitHub Copilot is your skilled driver, ready to drive you smoothly through your coding journey with the right guidance.
Now that you know what prompt engineering is, let's learn about some of its principles.

## Principles of prompt engineering
Before we explore specific strategies, let's first understand the basic principles of prompt engineering, summed up in the 4 S's below. These core rules are the basis for creating effective prompts.

- Single: Always focus your prompt on a single, well-defined task or question. This clarity is crucial for eliciting accurate and useful responses from Copilot.
- Specific: Ensure that your instructions are explicit and detailed. Specificity leads to more applicable and precise code suggestions.
- Short: While being specific, keep prompts concise and to the point. This balance ensures clarity without overloading Copilot or complicating the interaction.
- Surround: Utilize descriptive filenames and keep related files open. This provides Copilot with rich context, leading to more tailored code suggestions.

These core principles lay the foundation for crafting efficient and effective prompts. Keeping the 4 S's in mind, let's dive deeper into advanced best practices that ensure each interaction with GitHub Copilot is optimized.
