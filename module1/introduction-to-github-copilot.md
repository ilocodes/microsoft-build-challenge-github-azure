# Introduction to Github Copilot

Developed in collaboration with OpenAI, GitHub Copilot is powered by OpenAI Codex, an AI system created by OpenAI. OpenAI Codex has broad knowledge of how people use code and is more capable than GPT-3 in code generation, in part because it was trained on a data set that includes a larger concentration of public source code.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension for Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim/Neovim, and the JetBrains suite of integrated development environments (IDEs).

## GitHub Copilot Features
GitHub Copilot started a new age of software development as an AI pair programmer that keeps developers in the flow by autocompleting comments and code, but AI-powered autocompletion was just the starting point. Here are some features of GitHub Copilot that truly makes it a developer tool of the future, surpassing just an editor and into a readily accessible AI assistant throughout the entire development lifecycle.

## A ChatGPT-like experience in your editor with GitHub Copilot Chat

GitHub Copilot brings a chat interface to the editor that’s focused on developer scenarios and natively integrates with VS Code and Visual Studio. It recognizes what code a developer has typed, what error messages are shown, and it’s deeply embedded into the IDE. A developer can get in-depth analysis and explanations of what code blocks are intended to do, generate unit tests, and even get proposed fixes to bugs.

## Copilot for Pull Requests

This new functionality is powered by OpenAI’s new GPT-4 model, and adds support for AI-powered tags in pull-request descriptions through a GitHub app that organization admins and individual repository owners can install. These tags are automatically filled out by GitHub Copilot based on the changed code. Developers can then review or modify the suggested description.
AI-generated answers about documentation

GitHub is launching GitHub Copilot for Docs, an experimental tool that uses a chat interface to provide users with AI-generated responses to questions about documentation, including questions developers have about the languages, frameworks, and technologies they're using.

## Copilot for the command line interface (CLI)

Next to the editor and pull request, the terminal is the place where developers spend the most time. However, even the most proficient developers need to scroll through many pages to remember the precise syntax of many commands. GitHub Copilot CLI can compose commands and loops, and throw around obscure find flags to satisfy your query.
